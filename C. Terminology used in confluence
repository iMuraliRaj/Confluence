    a. Your content lives in pages – living documents you create on your Confluence site. 
    b. You can create pages for almost anything, from project plans to meeting notes, troubleshooting guides, policies, and more.
    c. Confluence comes bundled with templates to help you make beautiful pages for almost any kind of content.
    d. If you can’t find a template for the type of content you want to create, you can always start with a blank page.
